			# 	2) Otherwise, open the IRC channel in a web browser
			# other IRC clines could easily be added as 'elif' statements

			# And if it is, the user will be given the opportunity to listen to the live-stream in VLC 
			#
			# IF VLC is already running, we will open a new instance of VLC (open -n -a)
			# otherwise, we just open VLC (open -a)
